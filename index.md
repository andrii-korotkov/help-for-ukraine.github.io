# How you can help Ukraine

On February 24 2022 Russia has launched a large invasion to Ukraine with a goals to destroy it as an independent democratic state. Millions of innocent people became at risk of relocation or death. Ukraine keeps heroically holding its major cities, but with more enemy troops coming it needs your help now.

## Personal participation

Contact your government representatives and participate in local demonstrations for Ukraine support. Many countries' leaders are already helping Ukraine, but Putin haven't been stopped yet. Every bit counts and your participation increases the chances of government taking more action.

Share the information with your relatives and friends, get them involved into helping.

## Getting information

This topic has an international attention and many news outlets are covering it. Just avoid pro-russian and/or propaganda channels, as they often tell a complete opposite of truth. I personally follow US's CNN and New York Times, and Ukraine's Censor Net for a pretty good coverage with regular updates.

There's also a new project Ukrainian Witness by Vitaliy Deynega, the founder of one of the largest Ukrainian charity fund Come Back Alive. It's a chronicle of Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression. You can find it on Facebook and Instagram.

## Donating

There are multiple ways to donate via non-profit organizations or even the National Bank of Ukraine. Here are the ones I knew and trusted to donate.
* National Bank of Ukraine, which is Ukraine's central bank. It has opened a special account to raise funds for the army.
* Come Back Alive. Look for its Ukrainian name "Повернись живим" or Savelife. It's one of the largest Ukrainian charities, focused on helping with equipment, training, rehabilitation of soldiers.
* Nova Ukraine. It's a 501(c)3 non-profit, dedicated to strengthening a civil society in Ukraine focused and providing a humanitarian aid.
* Razom for Ukraine. It's a 501(c)3 non-profit, focused on supporting building a prosperous democratic society in Ukraine, providing critical medical supplies and amplifying voices of Ukrainians.
* Revived Soldiers Ukraine. It's a non-profit, focused on providing aid to Ukrainian people, including medical rehabilitation of soldiers.
* Ukrainian American Coordinating Council. It's a non-profit, representative body for Ukrainian Americans and people of Ukrainian descent. They are raising funds for helmets and armory vests.
